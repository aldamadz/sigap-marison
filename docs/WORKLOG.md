## 2026-10-19 [Codex] DASH-03 / Issue #638

- Active: `feature/actionable-role-dashboard-20261019`, isolated worktree from
  production `a69a35983cbdc1a2111f2d9c87371122d6478986`; staging target only.
- Removed obsolete dashboard Agenda widgets; added requester, assigned-signer
  and department/office queues, prerequisite/upcoming separation, SLA drilldown,
  named responsible people and explicit server-targeted reminders (six-hour
  deduplication). Current Work Calendar summary remains.
- User explicitly permits all members to monitor their organizational scope:
  Pusat department, exact KCP, KC plus descendant KCP. Approval rights unchanged.
- Forward migration `20261019090000` pending staging apply; audited live function
  definitions and ledger, no repair/replay. No production authorization/actions.
- Real disposable PostgreSQL tests cover RLS, dynamic hierarchy/cycles,
  inactive/deleted/anonymous actors, queue/history/business SLA and concurrent
  reminders. UI/docs tests and desktop/mobile light/dark visual checks included.
- Remaining: final changed gates, PR/CI, selected staging migration, deployment
  and live acceptance. `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` absent at task start; durable
  finding: read/detail predicates must not recurse through RLS, while monitoring
  scope never confers approval rights. Runtime proof follows in a dated entry.
